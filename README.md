# Utility
> This is an Simple and more easy android library where you can find many amazing solution. 

## Installation Utility solution

//Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```bash
dependencyResolutionManagement {
	repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Add Dependency Just go to your build.gradle Module:

//Add the dependency
dependencies {
```bash
	implementation 'com.github.mdnayeemsarker:Utility:1.0.2'
```
}

//If you use this dependency then you not need to add volley library in you project.
You just need to install this library, then you can call Rest API and get the response from it.

## You can use UConfig in your activity class or fragment.
```bash
	UConfig.RequestToVolley((result, response) -> Log.d("response", response), 0, this, "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1", new HashMap<>(), true);
```
This is the demo of API call here first you get the result is an bool and the response is string value you get the Rest API response, 
after you need to pass the api type which is POST/DELETE/GET/PUT/HEAD/DEPRECATED_GET_OR_POST/OPTIONS/PATCH/TRACE => 1/3/0/2/4/-1/5/7/6
then activity, url, parameter, bool val true is show progress display if false not show to display any thing.

//One more thing if you choose this dependency you not need to configure the SharedPreferences
simply use this.


## Declare USession class as a local or global variable in your activity or fragment and use the feature 
```bash
	USession uSession = new USession(this); // this for activity
    uSession.setData("string", "Utility By MD NAYEEM SARKER"); //for set string data
    Log.d("uSession String: ", uSession.getData("string")); //for get string data
    uSession.setInteger("int", 150); //for set integer data
    Log.d("uSession integer: ", String.valueOf(uSession.getInteger("int"))); //for get integer data
    uSession.setBoolean("bool", true); //for set bool data
    Log.d("uSession bool: ", String.valueOf(uSession.getBoolean("bool"))); //for get bool data
    uSession.setDouble("double", 165.656); //for set double data
    Log.d("uSession double: ", String.valueOf(uSession.getDouble("double"))); //for get double data
    uSession.setFloat("float", .656F); //for set float data
    Log.d("uSession float: ", String.valueOf(uSession.getFloat("float"))); //for get float data
    uSession.clearData(); //for clear all sesion data
    Log.d("uSession clear data: ", "Clear all session data");
```

## Please stay with me, more advance feature are coming. Thank you for using this library.
